    <h3>Chocolate Cereal Breakfast Bars – Better, Cheaper, and Way More Personal</h3>
    <p>When we were moving in, before the kitchen was set up, Michele and I would have a box of granola bars around for emergency snacking purposes, and while they served the purpose, every time I ate one I couldn't help feeling guilty since they're never great, often disappointing, and always expensive.</p>
    <p>What added to this culinary self-loathing is the fact that I know just how fast, easy and inexpensive this kind of thing is to make at home, which is what I'm happily sharing here. I'm still okay with the occasional store-bought bar, especially if it keeps you out of the fast food drive-through, but these really are superior in every way.</p>
    <p>This isn't really a specific recipe, but rather a simple method that allows you to create customized breakfast bars, energy bars, power bars, sports bars, or whatever you decide to call them. Pretty much any ready-to-eat breakfast grain or cereal can work here, along with all you favorite nuts, seeds, and dried fruits. No matter what goes in yours, I really do hope you give these a try soon. Enjoy!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <un>
        <li>1 ½ cups rolled oats</li>
        <li>1 cup puffed brown rice cereal</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped raw almonds</li>
        <li>⅓ cup shredded coconut</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>tiny pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>⅓ cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup maple syrup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
    </un>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <on>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8 pan with butter and line with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Combine rolled oats, puffed brown rice cereal, almonds, coconut, cocoa powder, salt, and cayenne in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Combine brown sugar, maple syrup, vegetable oil, and water in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Stir, and let the mixture boil for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour sugar mixture over the dry ingredients in the bowl and mix thoroughly. Transfer to the prepared pan, and smooth out the top, pressing lightly with a spatula.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. While still hot, use a spatula to score the pan into 8 portions. Let cool to room temperature before breaking into bars. You can also not score, and simply let cool, then cut with a knife.</li>
